ln-win consists of a JunctionPoint library and a port of the unix `ln`
tool for Windows, developed and maintained by Mahmoud Al-Qudsi
<mqudsi@neosmart.net> of NeoSmart Technologies <http://neosmart.net/>


ln.exe

* ln-win implements both hardlinks and softlinks for both files and
folders

* Create softlinks by specifying /s in the commandline

* Hardlinks are created by default (per the posix standard)


JunctionPoints library

* CreateJunctionPoint will create a reparse point (hardlink) for an NTFS
directory

* GetJunctionDestination will get the final target directory for a
symlink'd or hardlink'd directory. Files are not supported by this
function.

* DeleteJunctionDestination will remove the reparse point from a
directory


Install:

* Compile and copy the x64 build to C:\Windows\System32

* Compile and copy the x86 build to C:\Windows\SysWow64

* Use from the commandline as usual: ln.exe [/s] source destination
